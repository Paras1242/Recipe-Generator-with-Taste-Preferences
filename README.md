# Recipe Generator with Taste Preferences

A personalized recipe recommendation system that combines computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing to generate and customize recipes based on user preferences.

## Project Overview

The **Recipe Generator with Taste Preferences** aims to create a unique recipe recommendation experience that allows users to upload food images and receive an initial recipe suggestion. Using pre-trained models on the Recipe1M dataset, the system identifies ingredients from the image and generates a recipe. Additionally, with the integration of reinforcement learning and NLP, users can customize the recipe dynamically based on their preferences, such as "make it spicier" or "reduce sweetness."

### Key Features

- **Image Analysis**: Uses pre-trained computer vision models to analyze food images and identify key ingredients.
- **Dynamic Recipe Customization**: Allows users to modify recipes interactively through reinforcement learning and NLP.
- **User-Driven Adjustments**: Supports modifications based on user input, adjusting recipes for taste and dietary preferences.
